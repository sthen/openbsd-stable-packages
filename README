Scripts should be started in the correct order:

01_update_ports.sh	update the ports tree in /home/ports

02_make_liste.sh	create ~/fullpkglist containing ports to build

03_clean_packages.sh	delete extra packages and reinstall sqlports and rsync

04_make.sh		use "make package" and store logs

05_copy_packages.sh	create a list of packages from make show=PKGNAMES
			command and feed rsync with it

06_send_mail.sh		send a mail to tell sthen@ and naddy@ about packages
			to sign

The /build partition doesn't contain any important information and could be formatted if needed.
